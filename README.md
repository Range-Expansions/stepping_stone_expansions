# Stepping Stone Simulations

A package that I use to simulate the evolution of a spatially distributed population consisting of 
a line of connected demes. In each deme, we assume that there are N individuals with different
growth rates, mutation rates, etc. See the documentation [ipython notebook](https://github.com/btweinstein/stepping_stone_expansions/blob/master/docs/examples_of_use.ipynb) 
for examples of how to use the code.

# Examples

## Random initial fitnesses

## Muller's "Mutational Meltdown"

## A single deme (well-mixed population) with different fitnesses
